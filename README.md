## Introduction

This is a private bot for Discord running on NodeJS. It probably won't work without some form of modification for any other usecase than my server.

Feel free to contribute by sending pull requests or suggesting features, improvements or reporting issues.
Pull Requests will be made available as soon as I'm comfortable to let others work on the codebase. This will hopefully be the case in a few weeks from now!


## Requirements

NodeJS

npm

(mysql server if you don't want to use mine)


## Install


Navigate to the local repository.

Run "npm install".

Setup environment variables. Ask me!

To start the bot in development mode (it connects to the test server) run "node index.js dev". For productive mode "node index.js".


## Reporting issues

Issues can be reported via the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/aletuna/sweetiebot/issues).

Please take the time to review existing issues before submitting your own to prevent duplicates.


## Submitting fixes

JS fixes can be submitted via Pull Requests. Please use Google to find out how that works as there is plenty of information about that out there that explains the process better than I ever could. If you're stuck feel free to contact me!


## Submitting feature requests

Feature requests are to be submitted in the same way issues are reported. Use the corresponding Label to help the developers understand your intention.
